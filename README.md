# USBFlightControls_F-35
Lockheed Martin sponsored my Capstone senior design project to build a set of USB F-35 flight controls for training simulators. This is the firmware I wrote for the custom set of controllers built for the project.

The microcontrollers were PIC18F4550's on a custom PCB breakout board for connecting peripherals such as the USB cable, buttons and potentiometers. The firmware is written in C and compiled using MPLAB. There are three separate folders for each of the flight control assemblies. More project details can be found on the webpages below--
